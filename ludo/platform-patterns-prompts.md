- Specify "smooth curved shape" for organic platforms
- Include pattern/material within the shape
- These work well for: arched bridges, rounded platforms, S-curves, slopes

# IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

## Using Patterns in Unity

1. **Import as Texture2D** with Wrap Mode: Repeat
2. **Set filter mode** to Bilinear for smooth tiling
3. **Apply to platform sprite** using Sprite Shape or tiled sprite renderer
4. **Adjust UV scale** for desired pattern density

## Using Curved Platforms

1. **Import as Sprite** with tight mesh
2. **Use as-is** for fixed curved sections
3. **Combine with straight segments** for varied layouts
4. **Layer for depth** using sorting layers
