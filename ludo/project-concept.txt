CORE MECHANICS
=============================================================================

1. CART RIDING AND OBSTACLE NAVIGATION
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The primary gameplay mechanic involves players riding an auto-scrolling cart 
through the game's levels. This constant forward motion demands quick reflexes 
and precise timing. Players will need to jump over various obstacles that 
appear in their path, requiring them to anticipate upcoming challenges and 
execute jumps effectively. The auto-scrolling nature ensures a fast-paced and 
continuous gameplay loop, constantly pushing the player forward and maintaining 
engagement.

Key Features:
- Auto-scrolling cart mechanic
- Precise jump timing required
- Quick reflexes and anticipation needed
- Fast-paced, continuous gameplay


2. COIN COLLECTION
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Coin collection serves as a secondary core mechanic, encouraging players to 
explore the environment and optimize their movement. Coins will be strategically 
placed throughout the levels, often requiring skillful jumps or maneuvers to 
acquire them. This mechanic adds an element of reward and progression, 
potentially tying into scorekeeping or in-game currency for future uses. 
Collecting coins will likely contribute to player scores or unlock new content.

Key Features:
- Strategic coin placement
- Requires skillful jumps
- Contributes to scoring system
- Potential shop currency


3. AUTO-SCROLLING PLATFORMER STRUCTURE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The game's fundamental structure is an auto-scrolling 2D platformer. This means 
the screen continuously moves forward, dictating the pace of the game and 
eliminating the need for players to manually control horizontal movement. This 
feature streamlines the control scheme, making it ideal for mobile platforms, 
and focuses player attention on timing jumps and reacting to environmental 
challenges. The auto-scrolling ensures a constant, dynamic experience.


DETAILED MECHANICS BREAKDOWN
=============================================================================

AUTO-SCROLLING CART
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Behavior: Cart moves right automatically at constant speed

Speed by World:
- Forest (Levels 1-3): 5 units/second (slow, beginner-friendly)
- Mountain (Levels 4-6): 6 units/second
- Desert (Levels 7-9): 7 units/second
- Underwater (Levels 10-12): 5.5 units/second (slower for visual effect)
- Ocean (Levels 13-15): 8 units/second (fast, challenging)

Player Control: NONE over horizontal movement (only jump)
Wheel Physics: Wheels rotate, cart bounces slightly on landings


JUMP MECHANIC
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Input:
- PC: Spacebar or Up Arrow
- Mobile: Tap anywhere on screen

Jump Specifications:
- Jump Height: Fixed at 3 units (clears 2-unit tall obstacles)
- Jump Duration: 0.8 seconds (arc up and down)
- Gravity: Standard Unity gravity (9.81 m/s²)

Limitations:
- Can only jump when grounded
- No mid-air jump (no double jump in v1.0)
- Pressing jump while airborne = no effect

Feedback:
- Jump SFX
- Slight visual squash-and-stretch animation
- Dust particle on takeoff


COLLISION SYSTEM
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Three Collision Types:

1. HAZARDS (Deadly)
   - Types: Spikes, rocks, pitfalls, enemies
   - Effect: Lose 1 life, respawn at checkpoint
   - Visual: Cart shakes, character has "hit" animation
   - Audio: Collision sound + grunt

2. COLLECTIBLES (Beneficial)
   - Coins: +10 points, collect for shop currency
   - Extra Lives: +1 life (rare)
   - Power-ups (future): shields, magnets, speed boosts
   - Effect: Object disappears, counter updates
   - Audio: Pleasant "ding" sound

3. PLATFORMS (Neutral)
   - Types: Ground, bridges, ramps
   - Effect: Cart can drive/land on them
   - No special feedback beyond normal movement
