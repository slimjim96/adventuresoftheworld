## 🔄 Batch Generation Tips

**When generating multiple similar assets:**

1. **Start with 1-2 test assets** to validate style
2. **Use consistent base template** for the category
3. **Only change:** Object name, specific colors, unique details
4. **Keep constant:** Lighting, style keywords, negative prompts, format requirements
5. **Test in Unity** before generating full batch

**Example Batch: Forest Trees**

Tree 1 (Oak):
```
Large oak tree for forest platformer midground,
Rayman Legends style, vibrant green gradient leaves...
[REST OF MID LAYER TEMPLATE]
```

Tree 2 (Pine):
```
Tall pine tree for forest platformer midground,
darker green gradient needles, brown trunk, conical shape...
[REST OF MID LAYER TEMPLATE]
```

Tree 3 (Birch):
```
Birch tree for forest platformer midground,
white bark with dark markings, light green gradient leaves...
[REST OF MID LAYER TEMPLATE]
```

**Notice:** Only the first line changes. Base template stays identical.

## 💡 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: Getting 3D/Isometric Results
**Fix:** Add to negative prompts: `3D render, isometric, 3/4 view, perspective, depth angle`
**Add to main prompt:** `pure 2D side view, flat side profile, no perspective`

### Issue: Getting Ground/Base Under Objects
**Fix:** Strengthen in prompt: `isolated element, floating, no ground, no base, no floor, no shadow below`
**Add to negative:** `ground, base, floor, platform, terrain, soil, dirt, grass base, shadow below`

### Issue: Flat Vector Style (Not Painterly)
**Fix:** Add to prompt: `painterly brushstrokes, gradient shading, soft texture, traditional painting feel`
**Add to negative:** `flat colors, solid fills, vector graphics, hard edges, digital flat style`

### Issue: Wrong Lighting Direction
**Fix:** Strengthen in prompt: `IMPORTANT: light source from upper-left at 45 degrees, shadows cast to lower-right`
**Add to negative:** `bottom lighting, right-side lighting, top-down lighting, flat lighting, no shadows`

### Issue: Thick Cartoon Outlines
**Fix:** Add to prompt: `no outlines, soft edges, blended transitions`
**Add to negative:** `thick outlines, cartoon outlines, black borders, vector lines, comic book style`

## 📊 Asset Generation Order (Recommended)

1. **Cart** (1 asset) - Test first, all characters need it
2. **Cat, Dog, Lion, Bunny** (4 animals) - Validate character style
3. **Remaining 9 animals** - Batch generate once style confirmed
4. **Forest Far Layer** (3 assets) - Test parallax system
5. **Forest Mid Layer** (5 assets)
6. **Forest Near Layer** (5 assets)
7. **Mountain, Desert, Underwater, Ocean** (13 each) - Full environment batches
