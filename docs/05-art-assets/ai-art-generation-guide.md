## Batch Generation Workflow

### Step 1: Generate Base Set (4 characters)
Start with the original 4 to establish the style:
1. Lion
2. Bunny
3. Duck
4. Mouse

**Purpose**: Lock in the art style and consistency

### Step 2: Match the Style
Once you have 2-3 good examples, use them as **style reference**:
- "Generate in the same style as these images"
- Upload your best 2-3 characters as reference

### Step 3: Generate Remaining 9
Generate the rest using the master prompt + style reference:
- Cat, Dog, Elephant, Bear
- Unicorn, Fish, Fox
- Snowman, Dragon

### Step 4: Refinement
- Compare all 13 side-by-side
- Regenerate any that look inconsistent
- Adjust colors if needed in image editor

## Alternative Prompt (Simplified)

If the detailed prompts are too long, use this shorter version:

```
Cute [ANIMAL], flat cartoon vector art, simple 2D game character,
bright [COLOR], thick black outlines, happy expression, facing right,
transparent background, family-friendly
```

**Example:**
```
Cute dragon, flat cartoon vector art, simple 2D game character,
bright green, thick black outlines, happy expression, facing right,

## Image Editing After Generation

### If characters need adjustments:

**Tools:**
- **Remove.bg** - Remove backgrounds if not transparent
- **Photopea** (free) - Edit colors, resize, adjust
- **Inkscape** (free) - Vectorize if needed
- **Figma** (free) - Batch resize and export

**Common Adjustments:**
- Crop to same dimensions (512x512)
- Adjust brightness/saturation to match
- Add or thicken outlines
- Flip horizontally if facing wrong direction

---

## File Organization

Save generated images with clear naming:

```
character_cat_v1.png      (first version)

character_cat_final.png   (chosen version)
```

Keep all versions until project is complete!
